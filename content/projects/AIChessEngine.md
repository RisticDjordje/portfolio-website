For my AI class at Minerva University, I developed an AI chess opponent that could play reasonably well against humans and that I would enjoy playing against (~1900 ELO)

The engine has 4 modes: random, minimax with piece valuation, minimax with custom piece evaluation heuristics + positional evaluation heuristic, alpha-beta pruning. The engine is fully playable through the [Jupyer Notebook](https://github.com/RisticDjordje/ai-chess-engine/blob/main/ai_chess_engine.ipynb)
