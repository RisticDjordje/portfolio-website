Program that segments and extracts brain tumors from MRI images. This was my project as a Research Intern at [Petnica Science Center](https://www.petnica.rs/).

This project corresponds to my research paper _Ristic, Dj. & Tasojevic, J. Automatic Detection and Segmentation of Brain Tumors from MRI using Image Processing Techniques. Petnica Science Center, Department of Technical Sciences._
