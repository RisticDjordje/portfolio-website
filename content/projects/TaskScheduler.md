Created a task scheduler that takes in a list of tasks, their duration, dependencies (tasks that have to be completed before a particular task), whether they are flexible or have to happen at a fixed time and returns the optimal order for the tasks to be completed in. Implemented through a customly defined priority queue. This was one of my projects for my Data Structures and Algorithms class.
